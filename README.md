# Winter Music Player

I've separated out the information for the music player since it's the only use of React I can share for portfolios.
Playable site: https://github.com/readylilian/MusicPlayer/index.html

The site plays through various Christmas or wintry themed music, while the changes in the music are represented in the colors of the northern lights, the curve of them, along with the length of the spikes in the stars.
